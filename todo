For v1.2

*  Blast search dialogue should include a list of sequences that match both the forward and reverse primers

*  More intelligent sequencing primer design - search for primers around the midpoint between minimum and maximum distances, and then gradually move out

*  More complex primer-dimer routines - including detection of hair-pins and unequal primer-dimer internal loops

*  Ability to designate regions with starting/ending coordinates or starting/ending sequence strings, and assign colours and PCR ranges to such regions


Post v1.2

*  Methylation specific PCR?
