For v1.2

*  Use an in vitro PCR server rather than straight BLAST for checking primers.  MFEPrimer (http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/MFEprimer/) looks a good candidate.

*  More intelligent sequencing primer design - search for primers around the midpoint between minimum and maximum distances, and then gradually move out

*  More complex primer-dimer routines - including detection of unequal primer-dimer internal loops

*  More emphasis on RealTime PCR design?  Show primers on intron/exon map, for example?

*  Ability to designate regions with starting/ending coordinates or starting/ending sequence strings, and assign colours and PCR ranges to such regions
