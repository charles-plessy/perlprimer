For v1.2:

*  More intelligent sequencing primer design - search for primers around the midpoint between minimum and maximum distances, and then gradually move out

*  Automated design of overlapping BAC primer sets, including automatic BAC retrieval and repeat masking

*  Ability to detect and ignore repeat masked sequences

*  More complex primer-dimer routines - including detection of hair-pins and unequal primer-dimer internal loops
